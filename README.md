# MA324_GROUP2_QUANTILE_REGRESSION 

### Objective

Utilizing Quantile Random Forest to implement and deploy quantile regression on a dataset represents a sophisticated approach to data analysis. Quantile regression, an advanced statistical technique, facilitates the estimation of various quantiles of the response variable measurements, providing a nuanced understanding of the data distribution. This project aims to elucidate the process of applying quantile regression using the Quantile Random Forest algorithm, offering a comprehensive analysis of its implementation and utility.
